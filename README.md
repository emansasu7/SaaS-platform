Got the idea from 2 of one of my favorite Youtube Channels: [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow) and [Flux](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN7dywl5wDxTu1RM3eJ_h9Q)
-The goal was to design a landing page hero section using a random online generator for the idea, color pallete etc.
